## 📦 A New Home, Same Reliable Prints

Welcome, traveler of the GitHub realms! 🧙‍♂️  
You may remember this library from its humble beginnings over at:

**`https://github.com/selemxmn/ngx-print`**

But guess what? We've moved into a fresh new home that smells like TypeScript and clean commits:

**`https://github.com/ngx-print/ngx-print`**

## 🧳 Why the Move?

This project has grown, and it felt right to give it a dedicated organization — like finally giving your pet project its own comfy bed instead of the couch. 🛋️

So now:

- We have an official namespace: `@ngx-print`
- It’s easier to manage contributions and collaborators
- And honestly, it just looks a lot more legit 😄

## 🙌 Thanks for Sticking Around

Thanks for using `ngx-print`, whether you're printing invoices, reports, or memes.  
We're still the same project — just with a new address and a bit more flair.
